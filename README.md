This code creates a Flask web app for predicting the next day's stock closing price. Users input current day's stock data (open, high, low, volume), and a Random Forest Regressor model predicts the price for the following day. The prediction is displayed on the webpage.

Key Steps:

Import necessary libraries and set up Flask.
Define a route '/' to show the main page.
Define a route '/predict' to handle user input and predict stock price.
Read historical stock data from a CSV file and train the prediction model.
Collect user input and predict the next day's stock price.
Display the prediction on the webpage.
Run the Flask app in debug mode.
This compact code allows users to quickly get stock predictions through a web interface.
